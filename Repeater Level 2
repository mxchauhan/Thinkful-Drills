# This challenge extends the previous repeater() challenge. Just like last time, your job is to write a function that accepts a string and a number as arguments. This time, however, you should format the string you return like this:

# >>> repeater('yo', 3)
# '"yo" repeated 3 times is: "yoyoyo"'

def repeater(string, n):
    repeated = string * n
    line = '"{}" repeated {} times is: "{}"'
    return line.format(string, n, repeated)
