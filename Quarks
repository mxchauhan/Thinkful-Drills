# Background
# You're modelling the interaction between a large number of quarks and have decided to create a Quark class so you can generate your own quark objects.

# Quarks are fundamental particles and the only fundamental particle to experience all four fundamental forces.

# Your task
# Your Quark class should allow you to create quarks of any valid color ("red", "blue", and "green") and any valid flavor ('up', 'down', 'strange', 'charm', 'top', and 'bottom').

# Every quark has the same baryon_number (BaryonNumber in C#): 1/3.

# Every quark should have an .interact() (.Interact() in C#) method that allows any quark to interact with another quark via the strong force. When two quarks interact they exchange colors.

class Quark(object):
    def __init__(self, color, flavor):
        self.color = color
        self.flavor = flavor
        
    baryon_number = 1/3
    
    def interact(self, other_quark):
        self.color, other_quark.color = other_quark.color, self.color
