# Write a function take_umbrella() that takes two arguments: a string representing the current weather and a float representing the chance of rain today.

# Your function should return True or False based on the following criteria.

# You should take an umbrella if it's currently raining or if it's cloudy and the chance of rain is over 0.20.
# You shouldn't take an umbrella if it's sunny unless it's more likely to rain than not.

# The options for the current weather are sunny, cloudy, and rainy.

# For example, take_umbrella('sunny', 0.40) should return False.
